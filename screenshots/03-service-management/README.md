- `multi-tier-coordination.png` - Inter-service communication and dependency management

## Technical Implementation Details

### **Service Initialization Process:**
- Systematic startup sequence: Indexer → Deployment Server → Universal Forwarder
- Proper service dependency management and coordination
- Verification of service health and operational status
- Implementation of enterprise startup procedures

### **Service Configuration Management:**
- Configured systemd service files for automatic startup
- Implemented proper user permissions and security contexts
- Established service monitoring and health check procedures
- Created standardized service management workflows

### **Multi-Tier Coordination:**
- Verified network connectivity between all Splunk components
- Confirmed proper port accessibility (8089, 9997, 8000)
- Established secure communication channels between services
- Implemented service discovery and registration processes

## Service Architecture Details

### **Deployment Server Service:**
- **Service Name:** splunk (deployment server mode)
- **Key Functions:** Configuration management, app deployment coordination
- **Management Ports:** 8089 (management), 8000 (web interface)
- **Startup Dependencies:** Network services, storage mounts

### **Indexer Service:**
- **Service Name:** splunk (indexer mode)
- **Key Functions:** Data indexing, storage management, search processing
- **Management Ports:** 8089 (management), 9997 (receiving)
- **Resource Requirements:** High I/O, optimized storage access

### **Universal Forwarder Service:**
- **Service Name:** splunkforwarder
- **Key Functions:** Data collection, log forwarding, lightweight processing
- **Management Ports:** 8089 (management)
- **Target Configuration:** Deployment server managed

## Technical Skills Demonstrated:
- **Linux Service Management** (systemd/init systems)
- **Splunk Daemon Configuration** and optimization
- **Multi-Tier Service Coordination** and orchestration
- **System Process Monitoring** and health verification
- **Enterprise Service Architecture** implementation
- **Network Service Configuration** and troubleshooting

## Professional Value:
Core system administration and service management skills essential for enterprise Splunk environments, DevOps roles, and infrastructure management positions.

## Next Phase:
